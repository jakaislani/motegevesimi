Loughlin initially declined to enter a plea in April of that year but was convicted and sentenced to two months in October 2020. Hoffman was sentenced to two weeks behind bars in September 2019.</p><p>Other well-heeled parents sent to jail include Los Angeles wastewater systems honcho Devin Sloane, Connecticut lawyer Gordon Caplan, and Napa Valley winemaker Agustin Huneeus Jr. along with many others.</p><p>In total, prosecutors claim Singer’s multimillion-dollar scheme earned him over $25 million from his clients and paid bribes totaling more than $7 million. He also allegedly spent over $15 million of his clients’ money for his own benefit.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Actress Felicity Huffman, shown with husband William H. Macy, also was ensnared in the probe. <span class=credit>AFP/Getty Images</span></figure><p>For about a decade, the crooked admissions coach paid off college entrance exam administrators and proctors to boost students’ test scores.</p><p>He also bribed coaches to give the undeserving applicants spots on athletic teams, often for sports they didn’t even play, in the hopes it would boost their chances of receiving an acceptance letter to the school.</p><p>“He was the architect and mastermind of a criminal enterprise that massively corrupted the integrity of the college admissions process — which already favors those with wealth and privilege — to a degree never before seen in this country,” prosecutors wrote in court documents.</p><p>Singer pleaded guilty to charges including racketeering conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy in connection to the scheme in March 2019 — on the same day the scandal made headlines and shocked the nation.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Singer pleaded guilty to charges including racketeering conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy in March 2019. <span class=credit>REUTERS/Brian Snyder</span></figure><p>Ahead of his sentencing, Singer expressed regret and blamed his actions on his need to win “at all costs.” His lawyer has requested three years of probation or six months behind bars.</p><p>While Singer has remained out of jail, and never once been called as a witness in the cases that have gone to trial, he will get the chance to address the court before the judge hands down his sentence in Boston federal court.</p><p>If the judge agrees with prosecutors and sentences Singer to six years, it would be by far the longest sentence handed down in the case.</p><p>In addition to six years behind bars, prosecutors request the court order Singer serve an additional 36 months of supervised release and that he pay the IRS more than $10.6 million in restitution and forfeit assets valued at $5.3 million and $3.4 million in cash.</p><p>Singer has already paid $1,213,000 toward the $3.4 million money forfeiture, according to court documents. He is due to report to prison on February 27.</p><p>With Post wires</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2pmaWxfoq60wMSrpKKmlGK8p3nVmqmsoaSueqO41J6qZpufobmms8RmmJ2lmajAqrvNrGSsm5iauqZ506hkm51dqLKvwMSnmp6cXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./collier-gwin-dealer-sprays-homeless-woman.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Collier Gwin San Francisco Art Dealer Sprays Homeless Woman">&larr;
