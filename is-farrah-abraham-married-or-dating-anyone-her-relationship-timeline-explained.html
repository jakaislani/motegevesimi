According to Abraham, Parra was moving a little too quickly in their relationship and was demanding more than she was willing to offer. She also went on to describe him as controlling, which was inconvenient and uncomfortable for her. Speaking to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in Touch Weekly</a> about their break-up, Farrah said,</p><p>“What went wrong was that he was upset I wouldn’t kiss him yet and make more time for him and move to LA. He texted me saying he didn’t want to talk anymore. I have my values in line and I stick to them.&nbsp; I’m happy I chose not to touch him or get serious with some guy who seems controlling & clingy.
