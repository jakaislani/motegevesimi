He is also well recognized for his work in the 2020 television adaptation of Snowpiecer. Additionally,&nbsp;his&nbsp;work in the 2015 Broadway musical Hamilton is still talked about. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The talented entertainer is also active in the industry as a rapper, singer, songwriter, screenwriter, and producer.&nbsp;In his music career, Diggs is the lead vocalist in the experimental hip hop group, Clipping.&nbsp;</p><h2>Getting to Know Daveed Diggs</h2><p>Diggs was born in Oakland, California on January 24, 1982, as the son of Barbara Diggs and Dountes Diggs. His mother has a background in social work, while his dad is an experienced bus driver.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>A young Diggs attended Berkeley High School and later graduated from Brown University in 2004 with a bachelor's degree in theater.</p><p>Talking about his parents, the actor's mother, Barbara, belongs to a Jewish heritage while his father, Dountes, is African-American.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In 2015, the actor opened up about his childhood, acting inspirations, family, and culture during his exclusive <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with Broadway</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Firstly, Diggs talked about growing up as a poor shy kid with an affinity for acting.</p><p>In the chat, the actor talked about how from an early age, he&nbsp;"liked being on stage"&nbsp;because it gave him "a reason to be around people."&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, Diggs gave his insight into what acting&nbsp;always meant to him and said, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The other great thing about acting is it allows you to imagine circumstances different from your own. I was a poor Bay Area kid getting to pretend to be a Russian aristocrat.</p><p>Diggs, who belongs to a family of mixed races, never felt the cultures to be separate while growing up in his household.</p><p>Additionally, during his youth, Diggs identified himself as Jewish, but at the same time embraced his father's culture as well.</p><p>In the conversation, the actor/singer also talked about having many friends from mixed cultures during his early youth years. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, despite identifying his roots and embracing his <a href=# rel=follow>Jewish culture</a> and religion in his early life, the multi-talented actor did not have a Bar Mitzvah (a coming of age ceremony for Jewish boys when they are the age of 12 or 13). <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Black-Jewish Representation through Music</h2><p>In 2020, Diggs teamed with Disney and collaborated with his Clipping members William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes for the holiday song 'Puppy for Hanukkah.'</p><p>Per <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>, Diggs “was honored" after being approached by&nbsp;Disney Channel to do a&nbsp;"fresh Hanukkah tune." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>For the singer, it was an opportunity to share his love of music and give everyone "a little piece of my culture.”</p><p>The song is about a young boy who is desperately hoping to get a puppy as his Hanukkah present.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The song became an instant hit, and the song's official music video has amassed 1,460,800 views as of this writing.</p><p>Hanukkah is a Jewish festival&nbsp;celebrated among the Jewish community. The festival begins in late November and ends in the first week of December, comprising eight nights and days.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The festive period is widely considered to be the Festival of Lights or the Feast of Dedication.&nbsp;</p><p>Through the song, singer Diggs paid tribute to his Jewish roots, sharing a part of his culture and the religion he's learned to practice through his mother.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJyRq7KmsIydoKCfo2K9or7Ep6usZpipuq0%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./qnap-announces-ts332x-three-bay-nas-with-10-gbe.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="QNAP Announces TS-332X Three-Bay NAS with 10 GbE">&larr;
