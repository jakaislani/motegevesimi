Sam created SAMBRAND, an online store selling cosmetics, following her Big Brother Canada appearance.</p><p>In an interview with the Self(ish) Confidence podcast, Sam disclosed that she initially launched a business during her entrepreneurship course in high school.

Peter genuinely thinks that his future wife is out there and regards himself as a man of faith. He is eager to meet the Bachelorette and find out if she is the ideal person he has been searching for.</p><p>Never having the opportunity to fly his parents anywhere, he finally got the chance. He then approached the PA system and made his parents and the other passengers cry. “Mom, Dad, thank you for everything you’ve given me throughout the years…all you’ve sacrificed…I love you, and thank you so much.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Peter Cappio Career</h2><p>Peter Cappio, an airline pilot, has traveled the world as part of his career, something he highlighted on “The Bachelorette.” Known as “the life of the party,” Peter is a devout man who was still looking for his true love even with his ideal career.</p><p>He said he hoped to find someone who could match his positive energy and serve as his life’s copilot.
