He was the son of <strong>Eleanor Harte</strong> and <strong>Vernon Harte</strong>. Similarly, he belongs to white ethnicity and holds the American nationality. However, there is no prior information about his siblings.</p><p>Although Bob was born in New Jersey, he left the city life to live in the wilderness, close to nature, during the 1970s. In fact, at the age of 21, Bob hitchhiked to Alaska after his college graduation. His such life is what made him famous among the viewers. Besides, there is no information regarding his studies and education.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grace Elizabeth Age, Height, Model, Net Worth, Instagram, Wiki-Bio >></a></h4><p>Talking about his appearance, Bob was relatively tall and had a standard weight. Bob was an active and healthy man despite his lack of information regarding his exact measurements. But due to his sudden change in health, his influence, as well as his health, got worse.</p><h2>Bob Harte: The Last Alaskans Show</h2><p>The Last Alaskans is a reality television show from America that premiered on May 25, 2015, on Animal Planet. After that second season was released on April 12, 2016, on the Discovery channel. Likewise, the show had its season 3 aired on March 22, 2017, and the final season was premiered on November 25, 2018, on the Discovery channel.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cameron Boyce Death Cause, Age, Height, Jesse, Girlfriend, Net Worth >></a></h4><p>The show follows the lifestyle of several families living in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. Over the three seasons, Harte developed a loyal fanbase, including a large Facebook community with over 14,000 followers. On the other hand, Bob left the show temporarily to tend his cancer and returned shortly after recovery.</p><h2>Cause of Death</h2><p>On July 26, 2017, all the Last Alaskans fans&nbsp;were shocked by the sudden demise of Bob Harte. The star was reportedly found dead on July 22, 2017, in his sleep. Following the news, his memorial was held on July 29, 2017, at old Chena.</p><p>As many fans know, Harte was diagnosed with cancer and had previously left the show for treatment. But sadly, the procedure was not enough to keep him alive. Cancer took Bob from us, which is surprising since his treatment was going well. In fact, Bob had even planned to travel to Las Vegas and Death Valley after his recovery.</p><h2>Bob Harte: Son and Wife</h2><p>Regardless of his lifestyle, Bob Harte was a married man. He was married to <strong>Nancy Harte.</strong> Bob divorced her after living together for a few years. However, the pair had a stable relationship and respect for each other.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jodie Fletcher Biography- Age, Parents, Siblings, Net Worth, Instagram >></a></h4><p>The couple has one child named <strong>Talicia,</strong> who later had a daughter of his own named <strong>Carmella</strong>.&nbsp;Apart from that, Bob also was the foster parent of Steve. But there is no additional information about his family and their whereabouts as of today.</p><h2>Net Worth and Income</h2><p>Despite his simple lifestyle, Bob was able to amass a massive fan and income throughout his career. The last Alaskan show helped him earn most of his income as of today. At his time of death, Bob Harte had an estimated net worth of <strong>$600,000</strong>.</p><p>According to many sources, Bob used to brew his own beer and survive in the bush. Many even speculated that his earning might have been in millions if he was still alive.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK57waiZZqCRp8GmedOhnGakkajBbq3LmqqkmZ6oeqWxwK2fZqufo3qvsdNmrqiqpJ16uLXKomSboZ9k</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./stella-udeze-biography-age-movies-net-worth-pictures.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Stella Udeze Biography: Age, Movies, Net Worth &amp;amp; Pictures">&larr;
