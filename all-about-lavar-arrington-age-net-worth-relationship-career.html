He works as an NFL Network broadcaster right now.</strong></p><h2>What is the Net Worth of ABC? Salary, Earnings</h2><p>LaVar’s net worth is predicted to be $45 million as of February 2023. His sports career has earned him a lot of money. He rose to notoriety as a football player, well known for his signature move, “The Lavar Leap.” His real estate holdings include a residence in Annapolis, Maryland. As a broadcaster, he earns more than the national average of $75,637 each year.</p><p>In 2008, LaVar ventured into the culinary world, founding a restaurant in Landover, Maryland. His restaurant is called The Sideline. However, an accident occurred in front of his restaurant in March 2009, killing one person and injuring six others after an argument erupted into a burst of gunfire. Following that incident, the restaurant went insolvent and had to close in December 2009.</p><h2>Is ABC Single? Relationship</h2><p>Arrington is a married man with two children. His wife, Trishia Johnson-Arrington, is his true love. The pair met in Washington, DC at one of LaVar’s charity events. Trishia was instantly smitten when she first saw LaVar. But she didn’t know who he was at the time and had to ask her friends about him. She was, however, dissatisfied because there was a lot of bad news about football players at the time. After that, she became unpleasant to him, refusing to take pictures with him when he requested.</p><p>However, when she sat down and spoke with him, she was astounded by how down-to-earth and normal LaVar was despite being a football star. She was swept away by LaVar’s ideas and resolved to marry him if he was exactly the kind of person he claims to be. They’ve been together for over 14 years, and LaVar has remained the same.</p><p>The couple now has four lovely children: three daughters named Penn, Marlee, and Laila, as well as a son named Lavar.</p><p>LaVar was engaged in a major motorcycle accident in suburban Maryland on June 18, 2007. He lost control of his 2007 Kawasaki Ninja ZX-14 and slammed with a guardrail on the Route 50 off-ramp of the Capital Beltway. He was in critical condition when he was taken to the hospital, having suffered a shattered forearm, broken lower vertebrae, and extensive injuries to his leg. Fortunately, he was able to recover. He currently leads a happy and healthy life.</p><p><strong>Also Read, <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Aeko Catori Brown</a>, <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Jordana Lajoie</a>, and <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Cogeian Sky Embry</a>.</strong></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Footballer</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Professional Footballer From Iran National Team Mehdi Taremi</a></h3>Iranian footballer Mehdi Taremi currently competes for Porto and the Iran national team.
