Please continue reading this article to explore the whereabouts of Jerry.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Bruce&nbsp;was the proprietor of a Michigan junkyard, and his responsibilities kept him away from Sharee on a regular basis. His wife spent much of her time alone at home, using the internet to lure men and admitting to having a Machiavellian, manipulative mentality.</p><p>Jerry Cassaday, a former police officer, turned casino pit supervisor, and Sharee developed an online and physical relationship. Bruce, who is around 20 years Sharee’s senior, was claimed to have been aware of her online flirting conduct but had come to accept it as harmless.</p><p>Cassaday was obedient to Sharee and carried out her plan, which resulted in the death of her husband from a gunshot wound. On November 8, 1999, Bruce was assassinated at his workplace.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=photos-where-is-jerry-cassaday-today-arrested></span>Photos: Where Is Jerry Cassaday Today? Arrested<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In November 1999, Bruce Miller was fatally shot at his Michigan salvage yard, and the gunman was&nbsp;Jerry Cassaday.</p><p>Cassaday’s online lover, on the other hand, was the one pulling the strings.</p><p>Sharee Miller, the woman who had persuaded him to fly 800 miles to kill a guy he thought was an abusive spouse.</p><p>Cassaday died by&nbsp;suicide&nbsp;a few months later, bringing the web of falsehoods Miller built online to an end.&nbsp;Miller described her online connections with guys as a “game” to her.</p><p>“Each man and each relationship was like a different level to me, and each level was harder,” Miller said on “20/20” in November 2021.</p><p>“It was all about seeing how much I could get away with and how much I could convince someone to believe.” She further added</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=everything-on-sharee-miller-boyfriend-%e2%80%93-wikipedia></span>Everything On Sharee Miller Boyfriend – Wikipedia<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When Jerry Cassaday died unexpectedly in Odessa, Missouri, a murder inquiry was launched hundreds of miles away.</p><p>The documents and evidence discovered in Jerry’s apartment established a strong link between him and the 1999 murder of Bruce Miller, which occurred just months before Jerry’s death in 2000.</p><p>Jerry worked as a pit supervisor at a casino in&nbsp;Reno, Nevada,&nbsp;after retiring from the police force.&nbsp;Sharee, Bruce’s wife, saw Jerry in person at the casino a few months before he was slain while she was in town for a convention.</p><p>By then, the two had already communicated online and had begun a full-fledged relationship.&nbsp;Jerry met Sharee during a difficult point in his life, according to someone who knew him. He’d relocated to a new place, and his marriage was coming to an end.</p><p>Sharee lied to Jerry about Bruce being a member of the mafia and abusing her.&nbsp;Sharee also revealed to Jerry that she was pregnant with his kid twice despite being unable to do so due to a surgery she underwent many years ago.</p><p>Jerry had been in difficulty with the law and had lost custody of his kid by the time he killed Bruce.&nbsp;Jerry struggled much more after Sharee left him, and he became an abusive drinker.</p><p>Jerry was discovered dead in his Odessa apartment on&nbsp;February 11, 2000.</p><p>The 39-year-old was sitting in an easy chair, a Bible on his lap, and with a wound made by a .22-caliber rifle</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYmr%2BmecisZKOdoqfGbq%2FArKqanJGuerW7w5qwZquYlr%2BmsYymoKWklad6o7vYn6minZ6Zeqq61aijr52UYravecKopayomaeupMWMrZ%2BarF2hsqV506hkpq2imbKzew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./broward-mall-plantation-miami-fl-hours.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Broward Mall Plantation Miami FL Hours">&larr;
