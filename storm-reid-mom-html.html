She often gushes about them and shares stories of them with her followers.&nbsp;</p><h2>Storm Reid's&nbsp;Parents and Family&nbsp;</h2><p>The&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Euphoria</a> actress was born on July 1, 2003, in Atlanta, Georgia. Her parents are Rodney and Robyn Simpson, and she is the youngest of her siblings.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Storm Reid posing for a picture with her mom, Robyn Simpson.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Reid has an elder brother Josh and two sisters, Iman and Paris.&nbsp;They are of&nbsp;African-American ethnicity and race. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>She does not talk much about her father or siblings but often speaks proudly of her mother, Simpson.</p><p>On 2021 Mother's Day, Reid <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">took to Instagram</a>&nbsp;to express her gratitude towards her mom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Reid appreciated Simpson for everything she had done to date and thanked her for the "unconditional love and sacrifices." In addition, she said&nbsp;she could never repay for things Simpson had done for her. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Reid also opened up about the encouragement, perseverance, and lessons Simpson had taught her.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The actress gushed about how excited she was to see Simpson be a businesswoman. She revealed the mother-daughter duo closed a few business deals&nbsp;and was building&nbsp;a house together.&nbsp;</p><p>Reid also mentioned that people confused her mom for her sister.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Storm Reid's Mom Helped in Her Career</h2><p>Simpson has been there for her daughter through thick and thin.</p><p>In a 2019 interview with <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Teen Vogue</a>, Reid revealed that her mom&nbsp;always supported her dreams of becoming an actress.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Storm Reid with her mother, Robyn Simpson.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Reid knew she wanted to be in the entertainment world since she was three. So she confessed it to Simpson and said she wanted to be a "superstar."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Her mother believed in her dreams. Consequently, Simpson, Reid, and her sister&nbsp;moved to L.A. six years later from Georgia&nbsp;to fulfill the actress' wishes.</p><p>Thereon, Reid's dreams started manifesting into reality.&nbsp;She got to feature in&nbsp;12 Years a Slave and got her big break from&nbsp;A Wrinkle in Time. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>While Simpson is fully validating her daughter's career as an actress, she has also assured to be supportive if she ever left the industry.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>My mom has always said, if I didn't want to do it [acting] anymore then I could just quit, but I haven't wanted to. I feel like that's everyone's outlook. As long as I'm happy, that's what matters to them.&nbsp;</p><p>In November 2020, Reid wrote in a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">blog from Bustle</a>&nbsp;that her relationship with God kept her grounded. She then explained it was her mother who taught her to have faith.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>She shared that her mother&nbsp;guided her throughout her career, teaching her to be "unapologetically herself."</p><p>She also noted she was her travel and business partner, but never overbearing.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>Storm Reid and Zendaya Are Like Siblings&nbsp;</h2><p>Reid and <a href=# rel=follow>Zendaya</a> play the role of sisters, Gia and Rue, in Euphoria. However, their sisterhood is not limited to the HBO series only.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Storm Reid and her 'Euphoria' co-star, Zendaya.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The two are very <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">close in real life</a> and consider each other their siblings. Zendaya has often referred to Reid her "baby sister" and believes they are "real-life sisters."&nbsp;</p><p>The two support and gush about each other whenever possible. Their love and sisterhood have been apparent on multiple occasions, be it award shows, red carpet, interviews, or social media.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Reid showed her support to Zendaya for her latest movie, Spider-Man: No Way Home. She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">attended the premiere</a> and shared about it&nbsp;on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p>In the caption, she wrote she got to go to the premiere and&nbsp;support her "big sis."
