He kept the women captive in his house for years, where he tormented and raped them. Berry's escape on May 6, 2013, led to Castro's arrest. On August 1, he was sent to prison for life plus 1,000 years. Castro was found hanged in his prison cell on September 3, 2013, in Orient, Ohio.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Castro was born in Puerto Rico on July 10, 1960. As a child, he moved to Cleveland, Ohio, where members of his extended family already lived. In 1992, Castro bought a house at 2207 Seymour Avenue. He initially lived there with his wife and four children. However, Castro was allegedly violent with his wife and she left him in 1996, taking custody of their children as well.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Kidnapping Knight, Berry and DeJesus</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2002, Castro offered 20-year-old Knight a ride. Knight, who knew one of Castro's daughters, accepted. After Castro convinced Knight to come inside his house, he proceeded to rape her. Knight would be Castro's captive for the next 11 years. In 2003, Castro offered to drive Berry, then 16, home from her job at Burger King. Like Knight, Berry knew Castro's children and got into his car. She was also kidnapped, assaulted and held captive. Castro repeated the same scenario in 2004 with 14-year-old DeJesus, who was a close friend of his daughter, Arlene.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Castro kept the women chained in his basement for years before moving them to barricaded rooms upstairs. Throughout their captivity, Castro restrained the women and subjected them to multiple sexual assaults. When Knight became pregnant, which happened several times, Castro starved and beat her until she miscarried. He allowed Berry's pregnancy to come to term but forced her to give birth inside a plastic swimming pool.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for 5 Things Netflix Got Wrong About Jeffrey Dahmer" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/ep1-dahmer-thumbnail2-6463ea84d1489.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Facade During Captivity</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While holding the women captive in his home, Castro maintained a seemingly normal outside life. Family members still came to visit him, though he used locks to keep them from going into the basement and other parts of the house. He continued to work as a school bus driver — until he was fired in November 2012 — and played bass guitar with local groups. Castro even attended vigils for DeJesus, where he met with anguished members of her family.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Arrest and Sentence</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On May 6, 2013, Berry escaped from Castro's house. Police quickly freed the other women and arrested Castro that same day. In July 2013, Castro agreed to a plea deal that spared him from the death penalty. On July 26, he pleaded guilty to 937 charges, which included kidnapping, rape and murder (the murder charge stemmed from his role in ending one of Knight’s pregnancies). On August 1, 2013, Castro was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, plus an additional 1,000 years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Since his arrest, Castro has shown little remorse for his crimes. While in custody, he asked to see Berry's child, a request the court denied. In court, Castro insisted, "I'm not a monster. I'm sick." The three once-captive women, and Berry's daughter, are now living their lives freely. As for Castro, as Knight told him at his sentencing hearing, his "hell is just beginning."</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In a strange turn of events, Castro was found hanged in his prison cell at the Correction Reception Center in Orient, Ohio, at 9:20 p.m. on September 3, 2013. After prison medical staff tried unsuccessfully to resuscitate Castro, he was transported to the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, roughly 20 miles outside of the Orient. At 10:52 p.m. that evening, he was pronounced dead.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The following month, speculation surfaced that Castro's death might not have been a suicide, but rather, caused by auto-erotic asphyxiation — a sexual act in which an individual achieves pleasure through choking themselves, ultimately causing them to lose consciousness. Countering those assertions, the medical examiner who conducted Castro's autopsy, Jan Gorniak of Ohio, stated that she wholly believed that Castro had planned his death. "I did the autopsy myself. I saw the ligature. I saw the pictures of the cell," Gorniak said, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/10/justice/ohio-ariel-castro-suicide-guards/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="a report by CNN" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">a report by CNN</a>. "It was a suicide."</p><ul data-node-id=20 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Ariel Castro</li><li>Birth Year: 1960</li><li>Birth date: July 10, 1960</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Ariel Castro received a prison sentence of life plus an additional 1,000 years for kidnapping, torturing and imprisoning three young women in Cleveland, Ohio.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Crime and Terrorism</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Cancer</li><li>Interesting Facts</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Ariel Castro attended vigils for Gina DeJesus while she was being held captive in his home.</li></ul><li>Death Year: 2013</li><li>Death date: September 3, 2013</li><li>Death State: Ohio</li><li>Death City: Orient</li><li>Death Country: United States</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><ul data-node-id=25 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Ariel Castro Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/crime/ariel-castro</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: October 26, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 3, 2014</li></ul><ul data-node-id=28 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>I'm not a violent person.
